# Global Entry
Global Entry â€” travel mobile application that helps people quickly find information about visa requirements in different countries of the world. The app was launched in 2023, born out of our personal desire for such a resource. It soon became clear that we weren't alone in this need. The app is currently only available on the App Store for iPhone users.

You can also change your passport to compare visa conditions in different countries. But be careful that when you change your passport, the countries added to favorites will disappear. You can also view FAQ, contact us or read more about the app.

In the near future, I plan to introduce in-depth information about each country. This will help users gain better awareness before their visits, enhancing their travel experience!

# Development

When developing the application, I used third-party libraries such as:
- SnapKit for faster work with constraints
- KingFisher for smoother work with images and uploading them to the cache
- Firebase Storage for image parsing
- To work with data, I chose the Realm instead of CoreData, since the project is still small and there is no need to use a more complex database
- All information is stored with a big JSON file

Also about project:
- The architecture is mostly MVVM with the presence of MVC. Somewhere the work is implemented through protocols, somewhere there is using Combine.
- Dependency Manager: Swift Package Manager.
- GitHub for changes and commits.

# Attributions

## Database 

I used the database provided by the website Passport Index. According to Passport Index, it's a free tool built with publicly available information and content contributed by fans and government agencies from around the world. It's free to use the dataset under the MIT license.

For more convenient work with data, I used an open data project: https://github.com/ilyankou/passport-index-dataset/tree/master

## Photo Credits

I used photos with a free license from the Unsplash site, which doesn't require mentioning the photographers credit, but I will add their links later.
